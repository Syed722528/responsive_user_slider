                });
              },
              scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
              clipBehavior: Clip.antiAliasWithSaveLayer,
              itemCount: friends.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return FractionallySizedBox(
                  widthFactor: 0.90,
                  child: FriendTile(

                      title: friends[index]['name'],
                      onTap: () {}),
